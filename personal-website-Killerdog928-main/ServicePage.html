            <!-- Howdy!! I am Daniel Manning. I grew up in Houston, Texas and I attended Klein High School where I first started programming in my freshman year 
            and took classes in Computer Science and Cybersecurity every year. While at Klein I was an officer in the Computer Science Club and a member of 
            the Klein Orchestra. I earned my Eagle Scout Rank in Boy Scouts of America and was very involved in the youth group at my church. I continued 
            learning more about Computer Science and Cybersecurity at Texas A&M starting in 2022. I enjoy working on large projects and find much satisfaction 
            in making a nice presentable working product. My goal is to get a summer internship in 2025 and start working in the Computer Science 
            industry after I graduate in December of 2025. I plan on continuing my education to get a Master's degree while working. I am currently looking 
            into software engineering as a career after graduation.
            I volunteer at my church on a regular basis for anything they need help with in addition to helping at events such as Vacation Bible Schools and Teen Rallys. 
            I enjoy reading books, watching shows and movies, and playing games, along with doing anything with friends. I am a big fan of Star Wars, The Marvel 
            Cinematic Universe, The Lord of the Rings, and my favorite TV show is Psych. I enjoy board games such as Root and at the time of this writing I am slowly 
            working my way through the Elden Ring video game. I love all the books by Brandon Sanderson such as the Stormlight Archives and thoroughly enjoy The 
            Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan.
            I have interests in history, AI, cryptocurrencies, and politics and like learning more about them in the general sense in my free time.  -->
            Practice Branching!!!!!
